A big part of my life, especially in California, has been developing an interest in 
🌳 **iNaturalist**: [what i've been seeing lately](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=neckman_&verifiable=any) \
🐦 **eBird**: [what i've been hearing lately](https://ebird.org/profile/Mjg4ODc5Ng) \
**Stanford Birdwatching Club**: [what I spend some free time on](https://birding.stanford.edu) \\\
