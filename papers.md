This paper seeks to answer the question: what if making a gel _stiffer_ made it easier to inject? We report surprising trends in injection force for dynamic hydrogels and develop a new model to predict injectability. We hope this model and insight will be useful to users of injectable gels in the drug formulation and 3D bioprinting communities- it's a critical step towards connecting measured material properties and predicting operating conditions for injectors and extruders.

What controls the viability of encapsulated cells in injectable hydrogels? We use rheological tools including large-amplitude oscillatory shear to demonstrate the rapidity of the yielding transition, controlled by the network crosslink strength, is responsible for post-injection viability (while controlling for the network modulus).

We describe the fundamental roles of biomaterials as both manufacturing platforms and delivery vehicles for enhancing ACT, and highlight current and future applications of these materials-based approaches that could lead to improved therapeutic outcomes.
