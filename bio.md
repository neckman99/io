I'm a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Stanford, working on developing the next generation of polymer-based biomaterials to meet challenges from immunotherapy to drought resilience. I'm also a fellow at [HCVC](https://hcvc.co), where I am helping to build early-stage deep tech startups.

Prior to Stanford, I worked as an autonomy test & evaluation engineer/ cowboy chemE/ ocean modeler at [JHUAPL](https://jhuapl.edu). I got my ChemE degree from the University of Maryland, where I worked on 3D printing of composite materials at the microscale. I also was on the executive board of the [SGA](https://umdsga.com) for 2 years, where I spun up the [Student Facilities Fund](https://studentfacilitiesfund.umd.edu/), which has now allocated millions of dollars to student-based projects. In various internships, I worked for [ONI](https://www.oni.navy.mil) and in the multi-phase flows and heat transfer lab at Texas A&M.
