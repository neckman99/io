I'm a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Stanford, working on developing the next generation of polymer-based biomaterials to meet challenges from immunotherapy to drought resilience. I'm also a fellow at [HCVC](https://hcvc.co), where I am helping to build early-stage deep tech startups.

Prior to Stanford, I worked as an autonomy test & evaluation engineer/ cowboy chemE / ocean modeler at [JHUAPL](https://jhuapl.edu). In various internships, I worked for [ONI](https://oni.gov) and in the multi-phase flows and heat transfer lab at Texas A&M.
